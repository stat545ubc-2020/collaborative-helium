There are **3 errors** in this Rmd file. Will you find them all?

- 1 point per error fixed ($\times 3$ errors = 3 points)
- 2 points for knitting this document to an html file. 

## Welcome to R and Rmd!

This document is written in **R Markdown**. We'll use this document to explore the `mtcars` dataset.

First, let's store the current date as a variable. We can use the function `Sys.Date` with no arguments to get the current date:

```{r, error = TRUE}
_today_ <- Sys.Date()
```

Now, let's load the `tidyverse` (meta-) package:

```{r, error = TRUE}
libraries(tidyverse)
```

By loading the tidyverse, a function called `glimpse` has been made available. This function is useful for viewing a data set. Let's take a look at the `mtcars` dataset by applying the `glimpse` function to `mtcars`!

```{r, error = TRUE}
glimpse mtcars
```
